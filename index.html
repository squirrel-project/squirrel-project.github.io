    <h2>SQUIRREL at the Lange Nacht der Technik (Long Night of Technology) at the TGM in Vienna</h2>
    <div class="date">January 29th, 2015</div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>The <a href="http://www.tgm.ac.at">TGM</a>, one of the top HTL (H&ouml;here Technische Bundeslehranstalt) in Vienna, in cooperation with the <a href="http://pria.at">Practical Robotics Institute Austria (PRIA)</a>, organises the Lange Nacht der Technik (Long Night of Technology) to bring scientists in direct contact with students. The event invites visitors of all ages to learn about teaching and research at the TGM, presenting research projects by TGM students, invited scientific talks, and offering workshops from biotechnology to robotics. Furthermore Universities and companies present latest research projects. SQUIRREL will be present with the Robotino and demonstrates controlling a mobile robot with gestures.</p>

    <h2>Care-O-bot 4 is out there</h2>
    <div class="date">January 15th, 2015</div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Care-O-bot&reg; is the product vision of a mobile robot assistant to actively support humans in domestic environments. The meanwhile fourth generation of this successful development series is more agile and modular than its predecessors and offers various ways of interaction. The enhanced agility of Care-O-bot 4 is owed to the patented spherical joints around discreet pivot points on its neck and hips. They extend the robot&#39;s working space and allow 360 degree rotations of head and torso.</p>
		<p>Previous investigations have shown that social ways of interaction are essential for the acceptance of interactive service robots. As with previous generations, social role models were used as a guiding vision in developing the design and functionality. Using the display integrated in its head and based on the current situation, Care-O-bot 4 is able to display different atmospheres. While the concept for the Care-O-bot 3 was a more reserved, cautious butler, its successor is as courteous, friendly, and affable as a gentleman.</p>
		<p>Within SQUIRREL we will port the intermediate results from the scientific work packages to our second demonstrator platform Care-O-bot 4 in order to assess reusability of the developed components.</p>

    <h2>SQUIRREL at the Junge Uni Aktionstag 2014</h2>
    <div class="date">November 7th, 2015</div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>The Intelligent and Interactive Systems (IIS) group from UIBK will participate in the "Junge Uni Aktionstag 2014" ("Young University Open Day 2014") on November 7th, 2014 together with other
        research groups from this university. IIS will present the SQUIRREL Robotino robot to pupils from Innsbruck. The initiative "Junge Uni" wants to awake joy of science and research in children and
        adolescents. Seven to sixteen year olds will have the opportunity to see some small tasks and to interact playfully with the robot.</p>
